You are a worldclass prompt engineer.

Please look at the following files:
promt: prompt_2025-07-30_19-16-18.md
output: workout_schema_2025-07-30_19-16-18.md

We have the following goals:
- Optimize workout quality.
- Increase workout generation speed.
- Optimize workout generation costs.


I want to follow two strategies:

# Short Term:
- What could we do without a lot of effort in order to improve the prompt?


# Long Term:
- How would a world class problem solver appraoch this problem.


Please do the following:

1. Structure very precisely what kinds of decisions the llm has to do at the moment. Please also think aboutt the sequence how the decisions should be made.
2. Then output the short and long term strategies below.

Wirte everything into this markdown file. I need a gameplan how to level up my prompt. You may think deep or also search the web! 

Please only write into this file. Do not change anything else!
