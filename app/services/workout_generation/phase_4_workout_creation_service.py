"""
Phase 4: Workout Creation Service

LLM-creative workout design using pre-filtered exercises from Phase 3.
Creates structured workouts with logical progression, movement pattern balance,
and appropriate exercise selection.

Benefits from reduced context size (50-200 exercises vs 800+) for better LLM performance.
