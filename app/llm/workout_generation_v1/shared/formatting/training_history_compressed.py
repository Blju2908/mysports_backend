    Formats the training history into a compressed JSON format with clear labels.
    
    Features:
    - Only includes completed sets (status = done)
    - Uses clear labels (weight, reps, duration, distance)
    - Removes unnecessary fields (rest, notes, blocks structure)
    - Shortens date format to MM.DD
    - Reduces token usage by ~50-60%
